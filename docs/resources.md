### 1. Reference sequence and annotation
Download your prefered reference genome from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html), [Illumina iGenomes](https://emea.support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html) etc. and stored them in a dedicated resource folder. This should include at least the reference sequence (.fasta) and genome annotation (.gtf). 

## 2. Reference transcript sequence (Salmon)
In case you intend to run transcript quantification with Salmon, download the cDNA sequences of interest from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html). For example, the human cDNA can be obtained via the following link (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/homo_sapiens/).
