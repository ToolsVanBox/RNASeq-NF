### 1. Reference sequence and annotation
Download your prefered reference genome from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html), [Illumina iGenomes](https://emea.support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html) etc. and stored them in a dedicated resource folder. This should include at least the reference sequence (.fasta) and genome annotation (.gtf). 

## 2. Reference transcript sequence (Salmon)
In case you intend to run transcript quantification with Salmon, download the cDNA sequences of interest from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html). Alternatively, the transcript fasta can be generated with [RSEM](http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem/rsem-prepare-reference.html).
